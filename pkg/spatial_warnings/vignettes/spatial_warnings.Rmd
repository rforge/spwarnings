Ecosystems can undergo rapid and discontinuous transitions, even after a small 
change in their control parameters. Arid systems can go extinct, lakes can 
become eutrophized and forest patches can fail to maintain themselves, even 
after a small increase in the external pressure they bear. Those sharp 
transitions after a threshold has been crossed are gathered under the umbrella 
term of *critical transitions*. Some of them can even show irreversibility, 
where returning the external conditions to their original values is 
insufficient to restore the ecosystem to its original state. The latter type of
transition is a *catastrophic shift*. 

A body of theoretical work suggests that ecosystems should show some 
deviation in their characteristics before undergoing such a transition, hence 
the development of *indicators* or *early-warning signals* of critical 
transitions. These indicators are developed for time-series (package 
[earlywarnings](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/earlywarnings/)) 
and spatial data (this package). 

The *spatialwarnings* package provides user-friendly tools to compute, test for
significance and plot the indicators. This document provides an overview of the 
package and a possible workflow. 

The package provides many indicators, most of which falling into three broad 
categories, that are detailed thereafter with their corresponding package 
function: 

- "Generic" early-warning signals (`generic_spews`)
- Spectral indicators (`spectral_spews`)
- Patch-based indicators (`patch_spews`)
- Potential-analysis (`potential_analysis`)

This vignette will go through the suggested workflow for all these indicators
using an example dataset: the output from Kubo et al's (1996) forest gap model.

# Preparing your data 

The package assumes on raster-like data, *i.e.* values regularly-spaced point 
along a 2D grid. Some indicators can work on continuous data, however, some 
others require binary (1/0) data. Some conversion may thus be required before 
computing the indicators.

A conversion generic function `as.binary_matrix` is provided and will handle 
the conversion of discrete data to binary matrices for standard matrices, 
data frames or list of those (see Fig. 1). However, it is up to the user to 
convert quantitative data into a binary matrix if necessary (e.g. aerial 
imagery).

# *Generic* spatial early-warning signals

The rationale behind those indicators is a decrease in the return rates of a 
system (*Critical Slowing Down*, Scheffer et al., 2009) and the assymetry of the 
underlying potential near a critical point (Guttal et al., 2009).

These indicators can be applied both on continuous data and binary data 
(`binary matrix`). If the user supplies the latter, then an intermediate 
matrix is computed by coarse-graining (binning) the binary data into larger 
cells. 

```{r}
  library(spatialwarnings)
  library(ggplot2)
  
  # Load and make data available
  attach(forestdat) # make variable matrices and parameters available
  
  # Compute generic early warning signals
  test.dat <- generic_spews(matrices)
  test.summary <- summary(test.dat)
  
  # Plot along the replicate number
  plot(test.summary, along = parameters[ ,"delta"]) + xlab('delta')
```
