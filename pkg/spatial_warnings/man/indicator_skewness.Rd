\title{Skewness indicator}
\usage{
indicator_skewness(input, subsize = 2, detrending = FALSE,
  discrete = TRUE, nreplicates = 499)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A square binary matrix or a list of square binary matrices.}

\item{subsize}{logical. Dimension of the submatrix used to coarse-grain the
  original matrix.}

\item{detrending}{If TRUE data are detrended by removing the spatial mean.
  (Default is FALSE).}

\item{discrete}{logical. If TRUE the data represent discrete variables (like
  presence/absense), otherwise continuous data (like biomass density).
  Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{nreplicates}{Number of replicates to produce to estimate null
  distribution of index.}
}
\value{
A list (or a list of list if input was a list of matrices) with
  components:
    \itemize{
      \item `mean`: Landscape mean cover
      \item `value`: Spatial skewness of the matrix
    }
  If nreplicates was above 2, then the list has the following additional
  components :
    \itemize{
      \item `null_mean`: Mean skewness of the null distribution
      \item `null_sd`: SD of skewness in the null distribution
      \item `z_score`: Z-score of the observed value in the null distribution
      \item `pval`: p-value based on the rank of the observed skewness
                      in the null distribution.
    }
}
\description{
This functions computes the skewness critical point indicator.
  It also computes a null value obtained by randomizing
  the matrix.
