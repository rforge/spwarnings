\title{Moran's Index at lag of 1}
\usage{
indicator_moran(input, subsize = 2, detrending = FALSE, discrete = TRUE,
  nreplicates = 499)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{An matrix or a list of matrix object. It should
  be a square matrix}

\item{subsize}{logical. Dimension of the submatrix used to coarse-grain the
  original matrix.}

\item{detrending}{If TRUE data are detrended by removing the spatial mean.
  (Default is FALSE)}

\item{discrete}{logical. If TRUE the data represent discrete variables (like
  presence/absense), otherwise continuous data (like biomass density).
  Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{nreplicates}{Number of replicates to produce to estimate null
  distribution of index (default: 999).}
}
\value{
A list (or a list of list if input was a list of matrix
  object) of:
    \itemize{
      \item `mean`: Landscape mean cover
      \item `corr`: Spatial autocorrelation of the matrix
    }
  If nreplicates was above 2, then the list has the following additional
  components :
    \itemize{
      \item `null_mean`: Mean autocorrelation of the null distribution
      \item `null_sd`: SD of autocorrelation in the null distribution
      \item `z_score`: Z-score of the observed value in the null distribution
      \item `pval`: p-value based on the rank of the observed autocorrelation
                      in the null distribution.
    }
}
\description{
This functions computes the Moran's spatial correlation index
  (with lag one). It also computes a null value obtained by randomizing
  the matrix.
