# Indictest is a method for testing the significance of spatial indicators. 
# 
# This file only defines the global method and maybe some helpers. For each 
#   method, please refer to the task_* files. 

#' @title Significance-assessment of spatial early-warning signals
#' 
#' @description Assess the significance of spatial early-warning values
#' 
#' @param x A spatial warning object such as one produced by the *_spews 
#'   function family
#' 
#' @param nperm How many times should the input matrix be randomized
#'   to create the null distribution ?
#' 
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to methods 
#' 
#' @return An object of class \code{*_spews_test} depending on the input object
#'   (actually, a data.frame)
#'
#' @details 
#' 
#' The significance of many early-warning signals can be estimated by 
#'   reshuffling the original matrix. Indicators are then recomputed 
#'   on the shuffled matrices and the values obtained are used as a null 
#'   distribution. P-values are obtained based on the rank of the observered
#'   value in the null distribution.
